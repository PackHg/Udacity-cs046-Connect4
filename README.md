# Final Project: Connect 4
This is the final project for the Udacity's Intro to Java Programming course (cs046).

## What is it about?
* The aim is to create an agent (a game player) that can play Connect 4.
* Connect 4 is a popular board game, similar to an extended version of Tic-Tac-Toe.
* All of the graphical components (e.g., game board, pieces, etc.) I needed for this project are provided. I only need to implement my agentâ€™s game-playing logic.

This app is for educational purpose and learning to Programming with Java.

Keywords: Java, Programming, Connect 4, Udacity, cs046.
